#summary Some observations on Indic Languages and tesseract

= Introduction =

I did some initial Testing of Tesseract engine for Malayalam. I was basically interested in finding out how classifier of Tesseract handles Malayalam. This page will be updated as the work progresses. 

From initial observations, i feel like, there are some small bugs in pre processing and post processing routines of tesseract. Else its working pretty fine. I will soon train it with large data and get back to all.
