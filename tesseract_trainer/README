All examples below have been framed with a the language Bengali and hence the language code "beng".


To run:
1) Create a directory. In the directory you may create a maximum of 4 files:
		a)consonants- Put all the consonants in your script/language in the file. eg, ক , খ (ka, kha) etc
		b)pre_semivowels- Put all the semivowels that come before a consonant. eg,  ি, ে, ৈ  (e kaar, a kaar, oi kaar )
		c)post_semivowels- Put all the semivowels that come after a consonant, eg,  া, ী (aa kaar, ee kaar)
		d)rest- Put everything else here, like digits, punctuation, conjuncts, special characters, vowels
		
Now you need to know the directory in your system where all the font files are kept. In Ubuntu the truetype fonts are at /usr/share/fonts/truetype/.


Now type (for bengali for example)  python generate.py -fd /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-bengali-fonts/ -l beng -a beng.alphabet/

-fd takes the ttf fonts directory as input
-l takes the language to be trained as input
-a takes the alphabet characters folder as input

This command will generate many images and corresponding box files in beng.images. In the end it generates 5 files.
1)beng.unicharset
2)beng.Microfeat
3)beng.normproto
4)beng.pffmtable
5)beng.inttemp

These files will be automatically copied to beng.training_data folder.
There may be several images which generate FATALITY errors while tesseract processes them for training. These errors may arise for several reasons which can be found at http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/TrainingTesseract.
When an image generates an error, it is moved, along with its box file to a new directory named failure/. The user may analyse the errors and may decide to train these erroneous symbols separately.


These 5 files are needed by Tesseract-OCR engine to add a new script support. In addition dawg files are also required, for which you do not require
this tool. The 5 files along with some other files should comprise of these:
    * beng.freq-dawg
    * beng.word-dawg
    * beng.user-words
    * beng.inttemp
    * beng.normproto
    * beng.pffmtable
    * beng.unicharset
    * beng.DangAmbigs 
Copy these files to /usr/local/share/tessdata and to tessdata/ folder of you tesseract-ocr source code.

And yeah, this is work in progress.
